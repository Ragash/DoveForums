# DoveForums

Dove Forums is a brand new Bulletin Board software build from scratch on top of the Codeigniter & Twitter Bootstrap frameworks.

After nearly 3 years away from development due to work and home life, I have decided to give this project another go, this time making it Open Source to allow the community to also work on it.

The project goal is a simple one.  To make Bulletin Board software that is easy to use, install and customize and best of all Free!.  I am also trying to keep as much as I can native to CI without having too many external libraries cluttering up the code.  The following external libraries are going to be used as a starting point:

- HMVC 
- Ion Auth

This project is also been built on top of the latest Codeigniter & Twitter Bootstrap builds.  

If you would like to contribute to this project that would be great as I really would like to get this project back on track after so much time away from the community.

Regards
Chris
