# DoveForums

Dove Forums is a brand new Bulletin Board software build from scratch on top of the Codeigniter & Twitter Bootstrap frameworks.

After nearly 3 years away from development due to work and home life, I have decided to give this project another go, this time making it Open Source to allow the community to also work on it.

The project goal is a simple one.  To make Bulletin Board software that is easy to use, install and customize and best of all Free!.  I am also trying to keep as much as I can native to CI without having too many external libraries cluttering up the code.  The following external libraries are going to be used as a starting point:

- <a href="https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc">WireDesignz</a> - HMVC 
- <a href="http://www.benedmunds.com">Ben Edmunds</a> - Ion Auth
- <a href="http://www.ericbarnes.com">Eric Barnes</a> - Slug
- <a href="http://www.kylenoland.com">Kyle Noland</a> - MessageCI
- <a href="http://www.irealms.co.uk">Ryan Marshal<a/> - Gravatar

Thank you to all mentioned above for the great work on these libraries. 

This project is also been built on top of the latest Codeigniter & Twitter Bootstrap builds.  

If you would like to contribute to this project that would be great as I really would like to get this project back on track after so much time away from the community.

Regards
Chris
